			<h2>e-Commerce Project | <span class="project-title">Retnuh Co</span></h2>
			<img alt="Retnuh Co screenshot" src="lib/img/projects/1.jpg">
			<p>For this e-Commerce website project, I decided to go with the brand I'm currently working on and see what it would be like if I were to make an e-Commerce. Since this is something that I actually hope to start up in the future and have a success with, I figured this would be something really cool to start with. I designed everything from scratch, even the product images(real designs for the actual brand).</p>

			<h2>Encrypting passwords in PHP | <span class="project-title">Hunter Newton Photography</span></h2>
			<img alt="Encrypting passwords screenshot" src="lib/img/projects/2.jpg">
			<p>In this project, I learned how to encrypt passwords and have a sign in with a set password. Enter the correct password, you enter the site. Enter the incorrect password and you're stuck at the login page. For this project, the password is set to "test". </p>

			<h2>Lightsaber | <span class="project-title">The Dark Side</span></h2>
			<p>This project is simply a personal CSS project that I had been working on at the time. I wanted to practice my CSS skills by attempting to create a lightsaber from the famous movies, Star Wars. To activate the lightsaber, simply click on the ligtsaber handle.</p>

			<p>This is a random number guessing game. The computer generates a random number and you simply have to try to guess the number. You have two options for difficulties, Standard(random number 1-10) and Expert(random number 1-100). Want to play?</p>

			<h2>Javascript Challenge | <span class="project-title">Tabata Timer</span></h2>
			<img alt="Random Number Geussing Game screenshot" src="lib/img/projects/5.jpg">
			<p>This project is a challenge that was given to me while I was learning javascript. This was a challenge for me, I wasn't very good with javascript at the time and it felt impossible to complete by my deadline but I stuck through and finished.</p>
